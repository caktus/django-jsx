# django-jsx [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/caktus/django-jsx.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/caktus/django-jsx)

Django-JSX is a integration tool for Django projects using the excellent React
UI library. It enables direct embedding of the JSX syntax into Django templates
through a `{% jsx %}` template block. Your JSX will be extracted and compiled
along with your other front-end assets and rendered into your page.

Django-JSX makes React and Django work together.

## Features

- Embed React's JSX syntax directly into your project's Django templates
- Access the template's context variables inside your JSX attribute expressions
- Expose your library of React components to your traditional template developers


## Installation and Use

django-jsx requires Django >= 1.8 and Python >= 2.7 or >= 3.4.

To install from PyPi:

    pip install django-jsx

Add django-jsx to your Django settings' `INSTALLED_APPS`:

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'django_jsx',
    ]

Now, in your templates, you can use JSX and React components within a `{% jsx %}`
block easily.

    {% load jsx %}
    {% jsx %}
        <Dropdown input="section" options={ctx.sectionOptions} />
    {% endjsx %}

You'll need to include Django-JSX into your front-end build process. This includes
two steps. First, you need to run the `compilejsx` management command, which will
generate your "JSX Registry". This creates an ES6/JSX module you'll place with your
other front-end assets.

    python manage.py compilejsx -o project/static/js/jsx_registry.js

Now that all the inline JSX you used in your templates is extracted for your
front-end to use, you'll import those JSX snippets and render them all. You are
responsible for making all your React components available for this step in
the process.

    import jsxRegistry from './jsx_registry.js'
    import DropdownWidget from './widgets/dropdown.js'
    import LoadingWidget from './widgets/loading.js'

    jsxRegistry.renderAllDjangoJSX({
        DropdownWidget,
        LoadingWidget
    })


## How it works

* The `compilejsx` management command finds all the `jsx` blocks in the project's templates. It
  creates a jsx_registry.js file which has a snippet of javascript for
  each JSX block, which when called, will render the JSX.
  It also defines a `renderAllDjangoJSX` function which will do that for a given page.

* Include the output file from `compilejsx` when bundling your JavaScript. It uses
  ECMAScript 2015 features and so might need some transpiling.

* When rendered by Django, the `jsx` template tag is replaced by an empty script tag, whose purpose
  is to store (as a data attribute) a snapshot of the contents of the template context
  at that point in the template.

* At load time in a page with jsx tags, the page should call `renderAllDjangoJSX`. It will
  iterate over all the `jsx` script tags in the page's HTML, and render the appropriate
  React component into each one using the template context from the script tag and the Javascript
  compiled from the original JSX.

## Notes

* `jsx` blocks cannot contain other `jsx` blocks, or other Django template features such as block
  tags or context variables.
